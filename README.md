You wil see there are two files: "Fibonacci" and "Fibonacci_Withing_the_Program"

The regular "Fibonacci" is meant to be run in the command line. When entering the command to run the program, specify an argument that is a fibonacci number. The program will output all the fibonacci numbers that precede the number you inputted. If your numbeer is not a fibonacci number, the program will go up to the fibonacci number that is closest to the nnumber you entered.

"Fibonacci_Withing_the_Program" is a version of the program where you are prompted to enter your number within the program instead of as an argument. Do not enter any arguments when you run this program through the command line.
